IMPORTANT context weighting rules:
- If price action shows strong trend + news aligns → increase confidence
- If trade history shows poor win rate at current hour/day → reduce confidence
- If historical patterns show recurring event (e.g. NFP) → factor expected volatility
- When macro data conflicts with news sentiment, weigh macro data more heavily
- High ATR / volatility periods → reduce confidence unless signal is very clear"""

IMPORTANT: Summarize each factor concisely. Do NOT use emoji, icons, or unicode symbols.

Analysis framework — infer the asset class from the symbol ({symbol}) and apply the relevant lens:
- **Forex (EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, etc.)**: central bank policy divergence, rate differentials, CPI / jobs surprises, growth divergence, political risk. Base currency up = bullish pair; quote currency up = bearish pair.
- **Precious metals (XAU/GOLD, XAG/SILVER)**: Fed policy, real yields, USD strength (inverse), inflation, geopolitical/safe-haven demand, ETF flows.
- **Energy (OIL/WTI/BRENT, NATGAS)**: OPEC+ output, inventory data, supply disruption / sanctions, global demand outlook, recession risk.
- **Equity indices (US100/NAS, SPX500, US30, DAX)**: Fed policy, Treasury yields, earnings season, sector-specific (e.g. big-tech for Nasdaq), VIX / risk sentiment, regulatory risk.
- **Crypto (BTC, ETH, etc.)**: regulation (SEC/MiCA), ETF flows, macro liquidity, institutional adoption, exchange incidents, halving / on-chain events.
- **Single stocks (AAPL, TSLA, etc.)**: earnings, guidance, product launches, sector rotation, analyst actions, insider flow.
- **Unknown / hybrid**: fall back to general macro (Fed/USD/risk-on-off) and flag low confidence.

Cross-asset weighting:
- Weight recency: last 24h > last week
- Tariff / trade-war / sanctions headlines = high impact. Risk-off move = safe-haven up (gold, JPY, CHF, USD sometimes), risk assets down (equities, growth FX, crypto sometimes).
- Conflicting signals → neutral, confidence < 0.5
- Repetitive / opinion-only headlines → lower confidence
- Macro data (CPI, NFP, FOMC, ECB) overrides generic news."""
